Let's start a single page web application.

Suggest a directory structure and basic setup including the following:

www: the directory containing static files for the website
src/tools: directory for utils scripts we may create during development
src/tools/serve.py: A script to serve a website command-line arguments for port, www_root (default: 'www') and other useful things

The project should have a build process to build the web artefacts including linting, testing, minification according to best practices for this type of project.
It provides means to automatically build into a production ready version.
For development purpose a build variant builds the same without prod features like minification. This helps for debugging in the web console.

The target directory of the build process is the www directory.

Also create a .gitignore file for this type of project. In addition add the lines also:

.exec.sh
*.swp

Important: From now on, if you create folders or files that should not be added to a git repository, add them to .gitignore

Do this and apply best practices.
